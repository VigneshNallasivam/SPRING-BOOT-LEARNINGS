//INTRODUCTION TO SPRING-BOOT



                                                INTRODUCTION TO SPRING-BOOT
												===========================
What is FRAMEWORK?
-A framework in programming is a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development.
-A framework can include support programs, compilers, code libraries, toolsets, and APIs to develop software and create systems. 
-Open-source frameworks are always being updated and improved.

what is MICRO-SERVICES?
-Microservice is defined as the small services that work together. 
-The microservice defines an approach to the architecture that divides an application into a pool of loosely coupled services that implement business requirements).

What is REST API?
-Representational state transfer (REST) API is a software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between physically separate components, 
 often across the Internet in a client-server architecture.
-An interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet.
-It's used to fetch or give some information from a web service.

what is Dependency?
Dependency is nothing but a 'Library' that provides specific functionality that we can use in our application.

what is Deployment Descriptor?
-In a java web application a file named web.xml is known as deployment descriptor. 
-It is a xml file and <web-app> is the root element for it. 
-When a request comes web server uses web.xml file to map the URL of the request to the specific code that handle the request.

What is CLI?
Command Line Interface/Input/Interpretor(CLI)is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating-system(OS) functions.

SPRING-BOOT VS SPRING-FRAMEWORK:-
---------------------------------
KEY DIFFERENCE :-
-----------------
=>Spring framework is a java EE framework that is used to build applications.
  Spring Dependency Injection (DI) is the feature of the core module of the Spring Framework, 
  where the Spring Container injects other objects into an object. 
  Here, other objects are nothing but dependencies (instance variables) which are declared in the class (Spring Bean).
  Based on loosely Coupling( When an object gets the object to be used from the outside, then it is a loose coupling situation.)
  Other than tightly Coupling(When an object creates the object to be used, then it is a tight coupling situation.
                             object can not be changed from outside world easily marked it as tightly coupled objects.)
  This is one of the design Patterns

=>Spring Boot framework is mainly used to develop REST API’s
  Autoconfiguration is a method of automatically configuring a Spring application based on the dependencies found on the classpath.)
  Autoconfiguration can speed up and simplify development

3 CORE CAPABILITIES OF SPRING-BOOT:-
------------------------------------
#1.AUTOCONFIGURATION: It means that applications are initialized with pre-set dependencies that you don't have to configure manually.
                      As Java Spring Boot comes with built-in autoconfiguration capabilities,it automatically configures both the underlying Spring Framework and third-party packages based on your settings

#2.OPINIONATED APPROACH: Spring Boot uses an opinionated approach to adding and configuring starter dependencies, based on the needs of your project. 
                         Following its own judgment, Spring Boot chooses which packages to install and which default values to use, rather than requiring you to make all those decisions yourself and set up everything manually.
						
#3.STANDALONE APPLICATIONS: Spring Boot helps developers create applications that just run. 
                            Specifically, it lets you create standalone applications that run on their own, without relying on an external web server, by embedding a web server such as Tomcat or Netty into your app during the initialization process. 
                            As a result, you can launch your application on any platform by simply hitting the Run command.
							
Does spring boot replace spring?
-Spring Boot isn’t meant to be a replacement for Spring; rather, it’s meant to make working with it faster and easier. 
-As a result, the majority of the modifications required to migrate an application are configuration-related.

When should you not use a Spring boot?
-Spring Boot is not suitable for large-scale projects because Spring Boot creates a lot of unused dependencies, resulting in large deployment files.

What is Spring Boot best for?
Spring Boot means something that lets you bootstrap a spring application from scratch and the Spring Boot framework is mainly used to develop REST APIs.

What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a free, open source front-end(CSS,JS & HTML) development framework for the creation of websites and web apps.
